          Is it possible to fall in love with an aesthetic? This is the great
          power of design: it can create objects that touch us deeply with their
          brilliance. We love the dynamism and agility of our cars yet, at the
          same time, we stand for a responsible and refined type of performance.
          Audi represents spiritual values above material wealth. In producing
          premium cars, we combine high quality and perfection with
          accessibility and understatement. We dedicate our technologies to
          improving people's lives, to making better progress in our complex
          world - through smart solutions that work intuitively.
