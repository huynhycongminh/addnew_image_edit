          For Audi, sustainability is about having a value oriented
          responsibility to the future. About a balance between economics,
          ecology and society. It means looking at the big picture. Being
          transparent and acting with integrity are as much a part of this as
          taking a long-term and consistent view of things. For Audi, the future
          is an attitude: it's about taking moral responsibility and leading by
          example.
