            <p className="description">
              For Audi, sustainability is about having a value oriented
              responsibility to the future. About a balance between economics,
              ecology and society. It means looking at the big picture. Being
              transparent and acting with integrity are as much a part of this
              as taking a long-term and consistent view of things. For Audi, the
              future is an attitude: it's about taking moral responsibility and
              leading by example.

            <p className="description">
              Design is about more than giving a shape to cars. It is part of a
              greater, more powerful idea. It is about people and their
              passions. Audi is pushing the boundaries of the familiar design
              categories. Lighting, exterior and vehicle design are raised to
              new levels of inspiration and perfection. It demonstrates the
              power of stunning aesthetic innovation. Where others offer pure
              functionality, Audi offers customers deep emotional impressions
